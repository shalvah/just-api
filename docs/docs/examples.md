# Examples

You can find some examples on how to write test suites and tests in Just-API's test directory.

Just-API itself is filled with lots of tests covering all supported features.

Please checkout test suites available [here](https://github.com/kiranz/just-api/tree/master/test/specs/suites)

Test suites available there should be able to help you write tests for your APIs.
